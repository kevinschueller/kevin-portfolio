    content: 'I’ve worked with Kevin on some pretty big projects and I always walk
      away impressed by what he does. His ability to take a large amount of content,
      copy, and basically just ideas and put them all together to create web pages
      that are not only highly functional but also beautiful is just amazing. He is
      always open to suggestions and goes out of his way to explain why something
      might not work instead of being quick to shoot it down or criticize like some
      people might be apt to do. He is a friendly team player who always brings a
      smile and positive vibe to the office. He’s also ready and willing to roll up
      his creative sleeves when it comes time to collaborate and is a fountain of
      good ideas. I love working with Kevin and any team would be lucky to have him. '

    content: Kevin is a development rockstar! We recently worked on the redesign of
      the Morgan's Pier website together and I was beyond pleased with his ideas and
      solutions as well as his turn-around time. The site was built on the SquareSpace
      platform, but Kevin was able to custom develop many design elements and features.
      He was an absolute pleasure to work with and I look forward to our next project
      together.
