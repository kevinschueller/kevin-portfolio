I combine my extensive visual design and programming experience to create digital products that balance both form and function. I'm fascinated by the user experience and strive to create engagement with design and influence the audience. My interactive design philosophy is centered around removing guesswork for the user and making experiences easy. I design with industry standard tools like Adobe Creative Cloud and write beautiful code in modern text editors. Accessibility is important to me, and I strive for my design and code to meet WCAG 2.0 guidelines.

I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript--I have experience with Javascript libraries like JQuery, Vue, and React. I love to dig in, roll up my sleeves, and learn new things. Lately Iâ€™ve become fascinated by motion graphic design and video editing.
