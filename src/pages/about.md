I combine my visual design and web development prowess to create modern, functional, and user-friendly responsive websites and web apps. I’m fascinated by the user and strive to tailor web experiences to influence and meet their individual desires and needs. I design with Adobe Creative Suite and write beautiful code with Panic software. 

I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript--I have experience with Javascript libraries like JQuery, Vue, and React. Accessibility is important to me, and I strive for my design and code to meet A11y and WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Lately I’ve become fascinated by motion graphic design and video editing.
